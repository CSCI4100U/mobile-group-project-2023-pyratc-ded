Hiding tweets works per account, and poster's profile pictures can be viewed on their posts. Their profile will not update on tweets they have made if they update their profile - will fix this soon. Following tab coming soon - viewing people's profile coming soon - Signing out coming soon.

# Update 3
Liking and retweeting posts are now independent for each account! Each account tracks their liked posts, and different accounts can like each post.

# Update 2
Profile pictures + barebones settings works!

# Update 1
Many functionalities added.
Try out the functionality with Firebase, creating and signing into accounts, and creating tweets.

TODO - Adding profile pictures, making the likes and retweets local to each account (In theory, this app could work with many accounts, but in reality if one account likes/retweets something, it shows for every account), adding the following functionality, and adding the option to hide tweets.

Can get this done in 2 hours.
